**Design Patterns in Python**

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Python. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to solving recurring issues in software development, making the code more maintainable, scalable, and flexible.

**Creational Patterns**

Creational patterns are concerned with the process of object creation, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. **Builder Pattern**

    The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
    The implementation of the Builder pattern can be found in the Creational_Patterns/builder_pattern directory.


2. **Factory Method**

    The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    The implementation of the Factory Method pattern can be found in the Creational_Patterns/factory_method directory.


3. **Singleton Pattern**

    The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    The implementation of the Singleton pattern can be found in the Creational_Patterns/singleton_pattern directory.

**Structural Patterns**

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

1. **Adapter Pattern**

    The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
    The implementation of the Adapter pattern can be found in the Structural_Patterns/Adapter_pattern directory.

**Behavioral Patterns**

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

1. **Observer Pattern**

    The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to be notified when the state of another object changes.
    The implementation of the Observer pattern can be found in the Behavioral_pattern/Observer_pattern directory.

**Usage**

To use the design pattern implementations, navigate to the respective directory and run the main.py file. Each pattern has a main file that demonstrates the usage of the pattern.

For example, to run the Observer pattern, navigate to the Behavioral_pattern/Observer_pattern directory and run python main.py.
Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs.
